# ZK Mixer Project
- Deposit: users can deposit ETH into the mixer to break the connection between depositor and withdrawer.
- Withdraw: users will withdraw using a ZK proof (Noir - generated off-chain) of knowledge of their deposit.
- We will only allow users to deposit a fixed amount of ETH (0.001 ETH)
